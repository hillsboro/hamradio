For the DMR HAM community

Do you have a radio like the Anytone 878UV that cannot store more than 200K contacts?
Do you want to filter the contact list to include only active users on Brandmeister?
If you answered "Yes" to the above questions, this is for you!


As you probaby know, there are more than 200K Radio IDs on RadioID.net.
The RadioIDTrimmed tool filters the users.json file from RadioID.net based on the "Last Heard" contacts from the BrandMeister network for a specific list of Talkgroups.


Today, the BrandMeister tool does not expose an API for "Last Heard" contacts, so RadioIDTrimmed tool is unable to accept your talkgroups of interest. 
I am waiting on the BrandMeister API developer to expose the API.

Specific talkgroup IDs picked by the RadioIDTrimmed tool are:
91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 310, 311, 312, 404, 955, 3100, 3106, 3141, 3142, 3148, 3153, 31088, 40430, 98003 

Do you want other talkgroups added to the list? Send an email to srinival@gmail.com. 
A new json will be generated once a month and your talkgroups of interest will be added to the monthly update.
